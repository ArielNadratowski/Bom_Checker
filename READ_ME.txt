# BOM Checker

BOM Checker is designed to compare two bill of material lists (in either excel or csv) for differences in a visually clear and customizable way. 

# Credits
BOM Checker uses a custom tableview widget that can be found here: https://github.com/Deagek/tableview
Permission to use tableview was approved via messaging the creator over GitHub.

# Future improvements
1. Be able to check to ensure quantity matches the number of reference designators listed.
2. Add some sort of configuration file to customize what gets flagged as not matching (don't care whether its made by manufacturer 1 or manufacturer 2).
